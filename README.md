# odin-landing-page

In this little project, I will create a landing page from scratch according to the layout
given in the instructions from the odin project. I will use my knowledge about html and CSS that I acquired in the past few lessons, especially on the topic of flexbox. 

The landing page includes a header, four content blocks and a footer. I will first build the html and then style everything from top to bottom.
